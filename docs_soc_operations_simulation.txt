# SOC Operations Simulation

## Objective
Simulate SOC workflows using Wazuh SIEM, OPNsense + Zenarmor (NextGen firewall), Wireshark/Tcpdump (packer sniffers) and Suricata/Snort IDS to detect threats in a controlled lab.

## Steps
1. Deploy Wazuh server and agents (Windows, Ubuntu, Kali).
2. Configure log shipping from firewall, NAS, and endpoints.
3. Enable and tune IDS/IPS in OPNsense.
4. Simulate attacks:
   - Nmap scans
   - Brute-force logins (`hydra`)
   - Simple phishing attempts
5. Create detection rules in Wazuh.
6. Develop alerting thresholds.
7. Deploy and enable Wireshark against WiFi network adaptor
8. Document findings and lessons.

## Tools
- Wazuh
- OPNsense + Zenarmor
- Suricata or Snort
- Kali Linux (attacker)

## Outcome
- Custom dashboards
- Alert playbooks
- Improved detection coverage
