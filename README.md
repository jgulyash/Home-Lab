# Home Lab Projects

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Home Lab Projects** repository‚Äîa dynamic record of my lab activity designed to emulate real-world environments where I'm continuously developing, refining, and enhancing my capabilities across the cybersecurity and human risk spectrum, including **SOC operations, threat hunting, penetration testing, malware analysis, cloud security, and dark web intelligence**.

The goal of this lab is to simulate modern threat landscapes while practicing both **attack and defense methodologies**. Each project is aligned with industry-standard frameworks like the **MITRE ATT&CK** and includes end-to-end workflows‚Äîfrom adversary emulation to detection engineering and incident response.

This repository not only tracks technical implementations but also serves as a blueprint for:
- Building and tuning SIEM and IDS/IPS/XDR systems.
- Investigating endpoint and network threats.
- Executing penetration tests safely in a controlled environment.
- Conducting malware analysis and developing custom detections.
- Exploring cloud misconfigurations and AWS-specific attack vectors.
- Gathering intelligence from dark web forums while maintaining OPSEC.
- Leveraging **LLM and machine learning models** for automated detection and security analysis.

All activities occur within a fully isolated, self-contained, and legally compliant lab built on a robust foundation of macOS virtualization, Linux-based services, Windows environments, and AWS cloud infrastructure. This lab not only supports my continuous learning but also reflects how security operations are evolving with the integration of AI and cloud-native technologies.

## Projects

### SOC Operations Simulation

**Objective:** Build a SOC environment with Wazuh SIEM, IDS/IPS (Snort/Suricata), and OPNsense firewall for detection engineering.

**Steps:**
1. Deploy Wazuh server and agents (Windows, Linux, MacOS).
2. Configure OPNsense + Zenarmor for IDS/IPS.
3. Simulate attacks (Nmap, brute force, phishing) via Kali.
4. Correlate firewall and endpoint logs in Wazuh.
5. Create dashboards and alerts.
6. Document detection processes and improvements.

### Endpoint Threat Hunting & Forensics

**Objective:** Detect adversary behavior, persistence, and evasion techniques on multiple OS endpoints.

**Steps:**
1. Install Sysmon (Windows) and AuditD (Linux).
2. Simulate malware infections and lateral movement.
3. Analyze logs for:
   - Process creation anomalies
   - Unauthorized remote connections
   - Persistence mechanisms
4. Develop hunting hypotheses.
5. Document findings and detections.

---

### Penetration Testing Lab

**Objective:** Perform vulnerability discovery and exploitation against Metasploitable3.

**Steps:**
1. Scan with Nmap.
2. Identify exploitable services.
3. Use Metasploit and manual techniques to exploit vulnerabilities.
4. Conduct post-exploitation (privilege escalation, pivoting).
5. Write a penetration test report.
6. Map findings to MITRE ATT&CK.

---

### Malware Analysis & Detection Engineering

**Objective:** Analyze malware samples to craft detection rules.

**Steps:**
1. Isolate Windows VM (snapshot + no internet).
2. Obtain samples (TheZoo, MalwareBazaar - safely and legally).
3. Perform dynamic analysis (process, network, registry behavior).
4. Conduct static analysis (PEStudio, Strings, etc.).
5. Develop Wazuh detection rules.
6. Document analysis and ATT&CK mapping.

---

### AWS Cloud Security & Incident Response

**Objective:** Understand and detect AWS cloud security threats.

**Steps:**
1. Deploy AWS EC2 and S3 instances.
2. Introduce common misconfigurations (open S3, open SSH).
3. Simulate attacks from Kali.
4. Enable AWS GuardDuty, CloudTrail, and AWS Config.
5. Investigate and remediate incidents.
6. Write a cloud incident response playbook.

---

### Dark Web Threat Intelligence

**Objective:** Develop threat intelligence collection and analysis skills.

**Steps:**
1. Utilize a VPN-configured router for TOR over VPN layering.
2. Deploy Tails from a USB on a clean stand-alone machine.
3. Close all other apps that may be open on Tails.
4. Ensure JavaScript is disabled on the Tor browser.
5. NEVER reveal personal information. 
6. Optional: Create a digitally backstopped alias.
7. Explore .onion forums (using Ahmia, etc.).
8. Collect relevant TTPs and IOCs.
9. Sanitize software and hardware when finished exploring/collecting
10. Map to threat actor profiles.
11. Document and report findings securely.

### LLM/ML-Assisted Threat Detection

**Objective:** Automate threat detection using machine learning and LLMs.

**Steps:**
1. Install Jupyter Notebook on Ubuntu VM.
2. Export and parse Wazuh or firewall logs.
3. Perform anomaly detection using Python (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`).
4. Leverage OpenAI API to summarize logs or detect anomalies.
5. Build simple triage automation or detection models.
6. Document workflow and outcomes.
