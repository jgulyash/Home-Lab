# LLM/ML-Assisted Threat Detection

## Objective
Use machine learning and LLMs for security log analysis.

## Steps
1. Install Jupyter Notebook on Ubuntu.
2. Load logs from Wazuh, firewall, and/or endpoints.
3. Apply:
   - Anomaly detection (`IsolationForest`, clustering)
   - NLP with OpenAI API for summarizing logs
4. Automate detection or triage.

## Outcome
- Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- ML-powered detection models
