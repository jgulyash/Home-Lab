# ðŸŽ¯ Detection Engineering Playbook

## Objective
Develop and deploy detection rules for SOC operations using Wazuh, OPNsense, and IDS/IPS.

## Steps
1. **Log Source Inventory:**
   - Endpoint (Sysmon, AuditD)
   - Firewall (OPNsense)
   - IDS/IPS (Suricata/Snort)
   - Cloud logs (AWS GuardDuty, CloudTrail)
2. **Data Normalization:**
   - Use Wazuh decoders to standardize logs.
3. **Identify Use Cases:**
   - Port scanning
   - Brute-force attacks
   - Malware execution
   - Credential access attempts
4. **Rule Development:**
   - Create Wazuh rules based on log patterns.
   - Implement firewall alerts for suspicious traffic.
5. **Test Detection:**
   - Simulate attacks from Kali.
   - Confirm rule triggers.
6. **Tune:**
   - Reduce false positives.
   - Enhance rule specificity.
7. **Deploy to Production:**
   - Move tested rules to active monitoring.
8. **Documentation:**
   - Update rule registry.
   - Link to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

## Outcome
- Active detection rule set
- Mapped use cases to MITRE ATT&CK
