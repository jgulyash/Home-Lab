# ðŸš¨ Incident Response Playbook

## Objective
Provide a standardized approach for detecting, investigating, containing, and remediating incidents within the home lab.

## Phases

### 1. **Preparation:**
- Verify logging (Wazuh, firewall, IDS)
- Update detection rules
- Snapshot vulnerable systems

### 2. **Detection & Analysis:**
- Review alerts from Wazuh, firewall, IDS
- Correlate logs (endpoint + network)
- Identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Validate with threat intelligence sources

### 3. **Containment:**
- Isolate affected VM(s)
- Block malicious IPs on firewall
- Disable compromised accounts

### 4. **Eradication:**
- Remove malware or backdoors
- Reset credentials
- Patch vulnerabilities

### 5. **Recovery:**
- Restore from clean snapshots
- Monitor closely for recurrence
- Verify system integrity

### 6. **Post-Incident Activity:**
- Write incident report
- Update detection rules based on findings
- Conduct lessons learned session

## Outcome
- Documented IR lifecycle per incident
- Improved future readiness
