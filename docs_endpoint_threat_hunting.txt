# ðŸŽ¯ Endpoint Threat Hunting & Forensics

## Objective
Hunt for adversary TTPs, persistence, and lateral movement across Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

## Steps
1. Install Sysmon (Windows) and AuditD (Linux).
2. Deploy Wazuh agents for log collection.
3. Perform adversary simulations:
   - Credential harvesting (Mimikatz)
   - Reverse shells (`msfvenom`)
   - Fileless malware testing
4. Investigate:
   - Process tree anomalies
   - Unauthorized remote connections
   - Registry and cron persistence
5. Develop detection rules for Wazuh.
6. Document investigation workflow.

## Outcome
- Detection use cases
- Hunt hypothesis checklist
